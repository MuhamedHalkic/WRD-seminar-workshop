                        <div class="PMladic"><p>Fyodor Dostoevsky, born on 11 November [O.S. 30 October] 1821, was the second child of Dr. Mikhail Dostoevsky
                             and Maria Dostoevskaya (born Nechayeva). He was raised in the family home in the grounds of the 
                             Mariinsky Hospital for the Poor, which was in a lower class district on the edges of Moscow. 
                             Dostoevsky encountered the patients, who were at the lower end of the Russian social scale, 
                             when playing in the hospital gardens. <br>

                            Dostoevsky was introduced to literature at an early age. From the age of three, he was read heroic sagas, 
                            fairy tales and legends by his nanny, Alena Frolovna, an especially influential figure in his upbringing and 
                            love for fictional stories. When he was four his mother used the Bible to teach him to read and write. 
                            His parents introduced him to a wide range of literature, including Russian writers Karamzin, 
                            Pushkin and Derzhavin; Gothic fiction such as Ann Radcliffe; romantic works by Schiller and Goethe; 
                            heroic tales by Miguel de Cervantes and Walter Scott; and Homer's epics. Although his father's approach 
                            to education has been described as strict and harsh, Dostoevsky himself reports that his imagination was 
                            brought alive by nightly readings by his parents. 
                            

                            <br><br> 
                            
                            On 27 September 1837 Dostoevsky's mother died of tuberculosis. The previous May, his parents had sent Dostoevsky and his brother
                             Mikhail to St Petersburg to attend the free Nikolayev Military Engineering Institute, forcing the brothers to abandon their academic
                              studies for military careers. Dostoevsky entered the academy in January 1838, but only with the help of family members. Mikhail was 
                              refused admission on health grounds and was sent to an academy in Tallinn, Estonia (then known as Reval). <br>
                              On 12 August 1843 Dostoevsky took a job as a lieutenant engineer and lived with Adolph Totleben in an apartment 
                              owned by Dr. Rizenkampf, a friend of Mikhail. Rizenkampf characterised him as "no less good-natured and no less
                               courteous than his brother, but when not in a good mood he often looked at everything through dark glasses, 
                               became vexed, forgot good manners, and sometimes was carried away to the point of abusiveness and loss of 
                               self-awareness". Dostoevsky's first completed literary work, a translation of Honoré de Balzac's novel
                                Eugénie Grandet, was published in June and July 1843 in the 6th and 7th volume of the journal Repertoire 
                                and Pantheon, followed by several other translations. None were successful, and his financial difficulties 
                                led him to write a novel. <br><br></p></div>

                   <div class="PPoceci"><p>Dostoevsky completed his first novel, Poor Folk, in May 1845. His friend Dmitry Grigorovich,
                         with whom he was sharing an apartment at the time, took the manuscript to the poet Nikolay Nekrasov,
                          who in turn showed it to the renowned and influential literary critic Vissarion Belinsky. Belinsky 
                          described it as Russia's first "social novel". Poor Folk was released on 15 January 1846 in the 
                          St Petersburg Collection almanac and became a commercial success. <br><br>

                        Dostoevsky felt that his military career would endanger his now flourishing literary career, 
                        so he wrote a letter asking to resign his post. Shortly thereafter, he wrote his second novel, 
                        The Double, which appeared in the journal Notes of the Fatherland on 30 January 1846, before being 
                        published in February. Around the same time, Dostoevsky discovered socialism through the writings of 
                        French thinkers Fourier, Cabet, Proudhon and Saint-Simon. Through his relationship with Belinsky he 
                        expanded his knowledge of the philosophy of socialism. He was attracted to its logic, its sense of 
                        justice and its preoccupation with the destitute and the disadvantaged. However, his relationship 
                        with Belinsky became increasingly strained as Belinsky's atheism and dislike of religion clashed with 
                        Dostoevsky's Russian Orthodox beliefs. Dostoevsky eventually parted with him and his associates.</p><br><br></div>

                    <div class="PBitno"><p>The members of the Petrashevsky Circle were denounced to Liprandi, an official at the Ministry of Internal Affairs
                        . Dostoevsky was accused of reading works by Belinsky, including the banned Letter to Gogol,[46] and of circulating 
                        copies of these and other works. Antonelli, the government agent who had reported the group, wrote in his 
                        statement that at least one of the papers criticised Russian politics and religion. Dostoevsky responded to 
                        these charges by declaring that he had read the essays only "as a literary monument, neither more nor less";
                         he spoke of "personality and human egoism" rather than of politics. Even so, he and his fellow "conspirators"
                          were arrested on 23 April 1849 at the request of Count A. Orlov and Tsar Nicolas I, who feared a revolution 
                          like the Decembrist revolt of 1825 in Russia and the Revolutions of 1848 in Europe. The members were held in
                           the well-defended Peter and Paul Fortress, which housed the most dangerous convicts. <br>
                        
                           The first two parts of Crime and Punishment were published in January and February 1866 in the periodical The Russian Messenger,
                            attracting at least 500 new subscribers to the magazine. <br><br>

                           Dostoevsky returned to Saint Petersburg in mid-September and promised his editor, Fyodor Stellovsky, 
                           that he would complete The Gambler, a short novel focused on gambling addiction, by November,
                            although he had not yet begun writing it. One of Dostoevsky's friends, Milyukov, advised him to hire a secretary.
                             Dostoevsky contacted stenographer Pavel Olkhin from Saint Petersburg, who recommended his pupil, the twenty-year-old 
                             Anna Grigoryevna Snitkina. Her shorthand helped Dostoevsky to complete The Gambler on 30 October, after 26 days' work.
                              She remarked that Dostoevsky was of average height but always tried to carry himself erect. "He had light brown, slightly 
                              reddish hair, he used some hair conditioner, and he combed his hair in a diligent way ... his eyes, they were different: 
                              one was dark brown; in the other, the pupil was so big that you could not see its color, [this was caused by an injury].
                               The strangeness of his eyes gave Dostoyevsky some mysterious appearance. His face was pale, and it looked unhealthy."

                    <div class="PSmrt"><p>On 25 January 1881, while searching for members of the terrorist organisation Narodnaya Volya ("The People's Will")
                         who would soon assassinate Tsar Alexander II, the Tsar's secret police executed a search warrant in the apartment
                          of one of Dostoevsky's neighbours[citation needed]. On the following day, Dostoevsky suffered a pulmonary haemorrhage.
                           Anna denied that the search had caused it, saying that the haemorrhage had occurred after her husband had been looking 
                           for a dropped pen holder. After another haemorrhage, Anna called the doctors, who gave a poor prognosis. A third 
                           haemorrhage followed shortly afterwards. While seeing his children before dying, Dostoevsky requested that 
                           the parable of the Prodigal Son be read to his children. The profound meaning of this request is pointed out by Frank:

                        <br> It was this parable of transgression, repentance, and forgiveness that he wished to leave as a last heritage to his
                         children, and it may well be seen as his own ultimate understanding of the meaning of his life and the message of his 
                         work. <br><br>
                        
                         
                        
                        Among Dostoevsky's last words was his quotation of Matthew 3:14–15: "But John forbad him, saying, I have a need to be
                         baptised of thee, and comest thou to me? And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh
                          us to fulfil all righteousness", and he finished with "Hear now—permit it. Do not restrain me!" When he died, his 
                          body was placed on a table, following Russian custom. He was interred in the Tikhvin Cemetery at the Alexander Nevsky 
                          Convent, near his favourite poets, Nikolay Karamzin and Vasily Zhukovsky. It is unclear how many attended his funeral.
                           According to one reporter, more than 100,000 mourners were present, while others describe attendance between 40,000 and 
                           50,000. His tombstone is inscribed with lines from the New Testament:
                        <br><br>
                        Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it dies,
                         it bringeth forth much fruit.</p><br><br></div>
